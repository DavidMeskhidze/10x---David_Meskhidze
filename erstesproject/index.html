				The first season has drawn to a close for the TAG Heuer Porsche Formula E team. Now, all team members would like to take the time to say something important...
	
	A Formula E season is never easy â€“ especially the rookie one. But in the end, the TAG Heuer Porsche Formula E team can look back on a successful first season. The team threw themselves into the unknown, facing many challenges, but also celebrated many highlights. A very special highlight was the support we received from our fans and sponsors. And for that reason, it is time to say thank you.
